Training Epoch [0/20]:   1%| | 3/218 [00:03<02:51,  1.25it/s, acc=0.62104607, dice=0.21239907, iou=0.1188/share/etud/e2008984/miniconda3/envs/torch_env/lib/python3.9/site-packages/albumentations/pytorch/transforms.py:94: UserWarning: The given NumPy array is not writeable, and PyTorch does not support non-writeable tensors. This means you can write to the underlying (supposedly non-writeable) NumPy array using the tensor. You may want to copy the array to protect its data or make it writeable before converting it to a tensor. This type of warning will be suppressed for the rest of this program.
