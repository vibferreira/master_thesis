Training Epoch [0/5]:   1%| | 2/218 [00:02<04:09,  1.15s/it, acc=0.65078354, dice=0.26287523, iou=0.15132/share/etud/e2008984/miniconda3/envs/torch_env/lib/python3.9/site-packages/albumentations/pytorch/transforms.py:94: UserWarning: The given NumPy array is not writeable, and PyTorch does not support non-writeable tensors. This means you can write to the underlying (supposedly non-writeable) NumPy array using the tensor. You may want to copy the array to protect its data or make it writeable before converting it to a tensor. This type of warning will be suppressed for the rest of this program.
